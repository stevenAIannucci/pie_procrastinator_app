# pie-procrastinator app

Here's how it functions:

There is an image of a pie and the pie is updated over time as the user interacts with the app.
When the user starts a new project, the user will be asked to give the project a name and a list of tasks.
Once the user confirms their settings, they will be met with the default or incomplete pie.
When the user checks off a task in the task list, a slice of the new pie will take over the current one.
When the user finishes all of their tasks, the new pie will be completely take over the original and the app will congratulate the user.

Advanced features:

The user can set a deadline to complete the project as they are making a new one.
There will be gems on the frame of the pie with a maximum of seven.
After exactly 24 hours have passed, a gem will dissapear from the frame.
If all of the gems are gone, the user will lose access to their pie and the app will acknowledge the user's failure to complete the project before the deadline.
